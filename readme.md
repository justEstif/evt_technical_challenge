# Notes

## Tech Stack

- [docker](#docker)
- [docker compose](#docker-compose)
- [nginx](#nginx)

## TODO

- [ ] learn more about [docker](https://docker-curriculum.com/)
- [ ] learn more about [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [ ] learn more about [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/)

## Ideas

- bash script instead of docker compose?
- apache instead of nginx
- vagrant

## docker

- lets you run microservice applications in a distributed architecture.
- a container is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it.
- since containers are platform-independent, Docker can run across both windows and linux based platforms.

### why docker?

1. os support and architecture
2. portability
3. performance

## docker compose

With Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down.

## nginx

### Why nginx?

- it is stable, scalable, and can handle concurrency better than apache.
